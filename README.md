### What is a seedProject?
It is an idea and a consept and in time maybe a set of support tools for other seedProjecs.

If your ideas just stay in your head they will benefitt no one (eccept maybe you). If you share it, it can become something big. A seedProject is a low level publication of an ide. The project is typically unfinished and in its early stages. It is a seed in the sense that it can grow big if someone cultivates it.

Maybe your seed never grows, but you might have the braging right of being the first one to publish the idea.

### Who should NOT start a seedProject?
If you want to get a patent based on your idea you should probably not start a seedProject. Talk with a lawyer.

### Who should start a seedProject?
Everyone that is not afraid to share an idea.

### Ideas are easy, inovation is hard.

### Time is limited
You have to choose which projects you want to spend your time one. But maybe someone have time to spare for the project and maybe they can convince you that you too should spend more time with this project. 

### How do I use seedProjects?
Here on GitHub you can fork [mfrellum/seedProjects](https://github.com/mfrellum/seedProjects) and add and keep updated your list of your own seedProjects in the Projects/username-folder. Idealy seedProjects should be integrated in GitHub like Gists. Any good sugestions? Hey, seedProjects is a seedProject :)
